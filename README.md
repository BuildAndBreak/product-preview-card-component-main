# Product Preview Card Component

This project is a responsive product preview card built as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge.
It presents a CHANEL Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum product with its image, description, price, and a call-to-action button.

The goal of this project was to practice clean layout composition, responsive design, and consistent use of CSS custom properties for theming.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 – structured content for accessibility and clarity
- CSS3 – leveraging custom properties (variables) for maintainable design
- Flexbox – for alignment and layout responsiveness
- Media queries – to switch between mobile and desktop layouts
- Google Fonts – Fraunces and Montserrat for visual contrast and typography hierarchy

### What I learned

- How to structure a two-column layout that adapts responsively using Flexbox and media queries.

- Effective use of the picture element for serving optimized images based on screen size.

- Maintaining design consistency through CSS custom properties and reusable typographic rules.

### Continued development

- Extending the layout concept into a small product grid or e-commerce preview page.

### Useful resources

- [Media Queries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU7jJ3NbPdA) - This video helped clarify how media queries work and how to make layouts responsive across different screen sizes.
